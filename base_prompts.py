    "\n4. Keep proper nouns, symbols, and links in the original form."
    "\n5. Always ensure clarity and coherence in your translations."
    "\n6. For technical, scientific, or legal texts, ensure terminology accuracy by using domain-specific terms."
    "\n7. Adapt social media terminology to platform-specific conventions (e.g., use 'tweet' for Twitter posts)."
    "\n8. If the input is machine-translated, identify inconsistencies and improve fluency."
    "\n9. For creative texts, adjust tone and style to match cultural and audience expectations."
    "\n10. Break long or complex texts into smaller sections to maintain clarity."
    "\n11. Analyze the provided text to identify technical terms and explain each one in simple and understandable language.
